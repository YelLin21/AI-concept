A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and make predictions. It consists of:

Layers: Input (data), hidden (processing), and output (result).
Neurons: Units that process inputs using weights and biases.
Activation Functions: Add non-linearity for learning complex patterns.
Learning: Forward propagation (data flows) and backpropagation (adjusts weights to reduce error).

Types:
Feedforward: Basic classification.
CNNs: Image analysis.
RNNs: Sequential data.
Transformers: NLP tasks.

Uses:
Image recognition, language processing, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics.
